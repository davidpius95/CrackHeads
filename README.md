The global legal marijuana market size was valued at USD 9.1 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26.7% from 2021 to 2028. One of the major factors fueling the market growth is the expanding demand for legal marijuana owing to the growing number of legal cannabis countries.

Owing to the recent legalizations in different countries, the use of medical marijuana for various aliments is gaining momentum worldwide. Patients suffering from chronic illnesses, such as Parkinson's, cancer, Alzheimer's, and many neurological disorders, are administered medical marijuana. The demand for cannabis oil is increasing rapidly, especially among countries with legalized medical marijuana. Recent novel food ruling in Europe will further strengthen the growth of CBD isolates in the coming years. Moreover, the children consuming cannabis are being prescribed with oil only as it has shown tremendous benefits for the treatment of disorders, like epilepsy.
### What actually is medical marijuana?
Medical marijuana uses the marijuana plant or chemicals in it to treat diseases or conditions. It's basically the same product as recreational marijuana, but it's taken for medical purposes.

Limited research suggests cannabinoids might:
Reduce anxiety
Reduce inflammation and relieve pain
Control nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy
Kill cancer cells and slow tumor growth
Relax tight muscles in people with MS
Stimulate appetite and improve weight gain in people with cancer and AIDS.

### How does it help?
Cannabinoids -- the active chemicals in medical marijuana -- are similar to chemicals the body makes that are involved in appetite, memory, movement, and pain.


### Can medical marijuana help with seizure disorders?
Medical marijuana received a lot of attention a few years ago when parents said that a special form of the drug helped control seizures in their children. The FDA recently approved Epidiolex, which is made from CBD, as a therapy for people with very severe or hard-to-treat seizures. In studies, some people had a dramatic drop in seizures after taking this drug.

Researchers are studying whether medical marijuana can help treat a number of conditions including:
Alzheimer's disease, Appetite loss,Cancer,Crohn's disease
Diseases affecting the immune system like HIV/AIDS or Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

Mental health conditions like schizophrenia and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),Multiple sclerosis,Muscle spasms,Nausea,Pain,Seizures,Wasting syndrome (cachexia)
But itâ€™s not yet proven to help many of these conditions, with a few exceptions, Bonn-Miller says.
