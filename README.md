For a long time there has been several misconceptions around the use of marijuana many people have tend to believe that it is not a healthy substance but recent medical researches has proven that Medical marijuana is helpful in treating some major medical crisis. and help give quality education  to people on the use of medicinal marijuana.

Cannabinoids -- the active chemicals in medical marijuana -- are similar to chemicals the body makes that are involved in appetite, memory, movement, and pain.


### Can medical marijuana help with seizure disorders?
Medical marijuana received a lot of attention a few years ago when parents said that a special form of the drug helped control seizures in their children. The FDA recently approved Epidiolex, which is made from CBD, as a therapy for people with very severe or hard-to-treat seizures. In studies, some people had a dramatic drop in seizures after taking this drug.

Researchers are studying whether medical marijuana can help treat a number of conditions including:
Alzheimer's disease, Appetite loss,Cancer,Crohn's disease
Diseases affecting the immune system like HIV/AIDS or Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

Mental health conditions like schizophrenia and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),Multiple sclerosis,Muscle spasms,Nausea,Pain,Seizures,Wasting syndrome (cachexia)
